abstract = {We introduce Adam, an algorithm for first-order gradient-based optimization of stochastic objective functions, based on adaptive estimates of lower-order moments. The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

@article{Lauss2017,
abstract = {The adjoint method is a very efficient way to compute the gradient of a cost functional associated to a dynamical system depending on a set of input signals. However, the numerical solution of the adjoint differential equations raises several questions with respect to stability and accuracy. An alternative and maybe more natural approach is the discrete adjoint method (DAM), which constructs a finite difference scheme for the adjoint system directly from the numerical solution procedure, which is used for the solution of the equations of motion. The method delivers the exact gradient of the discretized cost functional subjected to the discretized equations of motion. For the application of the discrete adjoint method to the forward solver, several matrices are necessary. In this contribution, the matrices are derived for the simple Euler explicit method and for the classical implicit Hilber-Hughes-Taylor (HHT) solver.},
